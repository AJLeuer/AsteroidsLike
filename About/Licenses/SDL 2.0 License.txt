 *  Introduction
 *
 *  Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed
 *  to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and
 *  graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is used by video playback
 *  software, emulators, and popular games including Valve's award winning
 *  catalog and many Humble Bundle games.
 *
 *  SDL officially supports Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, iOS, and Android.
 *  Support for other platforms may be found in the source code.
 *
 *  SDL is written in C, works natively with C++, and there are bindings 
 *  available for several other languages, including C# and Python.
 *
 *  This library is distributed under the zlib license, which can be found
 *  in the file "COPYING.txt".
 *
 *  The best way to learn how to use SDL is to check out the header files in
 *  the "include" subdirectory and the programs in the "test" subdirectory.
 *  The header files and test programs are well commented and always up to date.
 *  More documentation and FAQs are available online at:
 *      http://wiki.libsdl.org/
 *
 *  If you need help with the library, or just want to discuss SDL related
 *  issues, you can join the developers mailing list:
